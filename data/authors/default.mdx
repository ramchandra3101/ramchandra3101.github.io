Hey, thanks for dropping by! ðŸ‘‹

Looking for a Software engineer who turns complex problems into elegant solutions? Your mouse click just landed in the right spot! ðŸ‘Œ

I'm wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science at UConn, where I've been diving deep into software development, machine learning, and NLP. With over 4 years of industry experience at SNCB International, Merck & Co, and now UCONN Health, I've built everything from high-performance payment systems to AI-powered healthcare applications.

Whether it's crafting clean code, training ML models, or scaling systems for millions of users, I bring the same enthusiasm to every technical challenge. Let's build something awesome together!
